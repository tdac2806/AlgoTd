Ex1:
1) [20, 5, 25, 3, 12, 21, 28, NULL, NULL, 8, 13, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL 6]
2) Non (25 est supérieur à 20), tamiser permer bien de faire un tas, [3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 20, 21, 25, 28]
3) [20, 2, 35, 50, 12, 885, 9, 7] => [2, 7, 9, 12, 20, 35, 50, 885]

Ex2:
1)[25, 40, 2, 65, 10] => [65, 40, 2, 25, 10] => [40, 25, 2, 10, 65] => [25, 10, 2, 40, 65] => [10, 2, 25, 40, 65] => [2, 10, 25, 40, 65]
2)[10, 50, 1, 25, 35, 15] => [50, 35, 15, 10, 25, 1] => [35, 25, 15, 1, 10, 50]
